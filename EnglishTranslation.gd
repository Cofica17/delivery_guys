	• Each player takes turns and throws a couple of dice.
	• Add the numbers on dice. E.g. the dice show 6 and 5, which makes 11 in total. That means the player can eliminate numbers that add up to 11:
    6+5(eliminate 6 and 5)
    2+3+6(eliminate 2,3 and 6)
    1+2+3+5 (eliminate 1,2,3 and 6)
et cetera.
	• A number can be eliminated only once.
	• A player's turn ends when his/her throw is useless: E.g. the throw gives 1 and 2, a total of 3. This means only possibilities are 1+2 or only 3. Let's say 2 and 3 are eliminated already. That means the player can not make any move, hence the turn ends.
	• The player who eliminated the most number of packages is the winner.""",

One day, Ali and three of his friends decided to use the only bridge this little village has and go camping across the river. The bridge of Togan became a wreck after years of neglect. It had such a bad condition that its strength could only allow two people to walk at the same time.

As the night fall onto the four friends, the weather got worse and a storm broke out all of a sudden. The four friends quickly decided to pack and go back to the village. Though when they reached the bridge, only one of their lamps survived the heavy storm. Since it was too dark they needed a light to cross the bridge which added another problem to the bridge’s existing condition.

Also, these four friends were crossing the bridge with different speeds:
Aslı: 1 minute
Ali: 2 minutes
Necdet: 6 minutes
Selin: 10 minutes
Your goal is to find the quickest way to cross the bridge.""",

	• Since there is only one lamp, until there is no one left in the camping side of the bridge, one must bring back the lamp to the camping side. """,
